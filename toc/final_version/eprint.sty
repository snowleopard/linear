%% version 2.13   date: 2018-05-27

%% Description
%% -----------
%% Defines macros for various archives
%% These macros are called while typesetting bibliographies
%% using the tocplain style.
%%
%% EPRINT_FORMAT -> ENTRY, ENTRY, ... ,ENTRY
%% ENTRY -> ARCHIVE:IDENTIFIER | IDENTIFIER
%% IDENTIFIER -> ARG | ARG/IDENTIFIER
%% ARG -> string without "/:, "
%% ARCHIVE -> string consisting of only alphabets
%%
%% Every ENTRY of the form IDENTIFIER is equivalent to
%%  the entry arxiv:IDENTIFIER
%%

%% Acknowledgement
%% ---------------
%%   The code for \ep@slashparser and \ep@ledef have been
%% possible due to comp.text.tex newgroup members.

%% For each archive X we need some macros of the form
%% ep@X@Y where Y is one,two,three,four,five,six,all
%%
%% if ep@X@all exists it is called. Otherwise the number of arguments
%% is computed and ep@X@<n> is called where <n> is the number
%% of arguments. ep@X@<n> should be a macro which takes <n> arguments.
%%
%% More often than not, a group of archives handle identifiers in a 
%% similar way. In that case usually one has one generic macro which
%% in addition to the <n> arguments takes the name of the archive
%% (as it should be typeset) as its first argument. In such a case
%% you can use \ep@makemacro@* macros to save you some work.
