Andrey Mokhov is a software engineer at Jane Street London, and a visiting fellow at Newcastle University, UK. His research interests are in 
applying abstract mathematics and functional programming to solving large-scale engineering problems. During his PhD (2005-2009), Andrey worked 
on asynchronous circuits and concurrency theory. In 2014, he became interested in functional programming and software build systems, which 
eventually led him to writing more and more code, and in 2019, he switched from academia to industry, joining Jane Streetâ€™s Tools and Compilers 
team. Andrey is originally from Kyrgyzstan where he helps to run the ACM ICPC regional programming contest.
